      Developing the Theory of Evolution
      Darwin on the HMS Beagle
      When Darwin began his journey, most people thought the world was ~6000 years old, and that the animals and plants were unchanging
      Darwin’s job on the Beagle was to be a naturalist, and to collect biological and geological specimens during the travels
      The Galápagos Islands
      Darwin noticed that the different islands all seemed to have their own, slightly different varieties of animals
      Almost every specimen Darwin collected on the Galápagos was new to European scientists, though they were similar to species on the mainland South America
      Island and mainland species should not have been so similar, unless mainland species had changed since arriving on the islands
      Darwin continued his Studies
      Darwin hypothesized that new species could appear gradually through small changes in ancestral species
      Darwin inferred that if humans could change species by artificial selection - directed breeding to produce offspring with desired traits, then perhaps the same process could work in nature
      Natural Selection
      Darwin described the process of natural selection: some competitors would be better equipped for survival than others, those less equipped would die
