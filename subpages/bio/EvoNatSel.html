    <h2>Evolution and Natural Selection</h2>

    <h3>Developing the Theory of Evolution</h3>

    <ul class="roman">
      <li>Darwin on the HMS Beagle</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>When Darwin began his journey, most people thought the world was ~6000 years old, and that the animals and plants were unchanging</li>
        <li>Darwin’s job on the Beagle was to be a naturalist, and to collect biological and geological specimens during the travels</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The Galápagos Islands</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>Darwin noticed that the different islands all seemed to have their own, slightly different varieties of animals</li>
        <li>Almost every specimen Darwin collected on the Galápagos was new to European scientists, though they were similar to species on the mainland South America</li>
        <li>Island and mainland species should not have been so similar, unless mainland species had changed since arriving on the islands</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Darwin continued his Studies</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>Darwin hypothesized that new species could appear gradually through small changes in ancestral species</li>
        <li>Darwin inferred that if humans could change species by <b>artificial selection</b> - directed breeding to produce offspring with desired traits, then perhaps the same process could work in nature</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Natural Selection</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>Darwin described the process of <b>natural selection</b>: some competitors would be better equipped for survival than others, those less equipped would die</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Principles of natural selection</ul>
      <ul class="letter">
        <li>Individuals show variation</li>
        <li>Variations are heritable</li>
        <li>More offspring are born than can survive</li>
        <li>Variations that increase reproductive success will be more common in the next generation</li>
      </ul>
      <li><i>The Origin of Species</i></li>
      <ul class="letter">
        <li>Darwin published <i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</i> in 1859</li>
        <li>Today, scientists use <b>evolution</b> to mean cumulative change in a group of organisms through time</li>
        <li>Natural selection is not synonymous with evolution - it is a mechanism by which evolution occurs</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Natural Selection = Survival of the Fittest</li>
      <ul class="letter">
        <li>Natural Selection is the survival of the fittest - those with the most favorable traits for survival will reproduce and pass those traits on to their offspring</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
