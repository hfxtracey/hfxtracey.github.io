      <li>Darwin on the HMS Beagle</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>When Darwin began his journey, most people thought the world was ~6000 years old, and that the animals and plants were unchanging</li>
        <li>Darwin’s job on the Beagle was to be a naturalist, and to collect biological and geological specimens during the travels</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The Galápagos Islands</li>
      <ul> class="number">
        <li>Darwin noticed that the different islands all seemed to have their own, slightly different varieties of animals</li>
        <li>Almost every specimen Darwin collected on the Galápagos was new to European scientists, though they were similar to species on the mainland South America</li>
        <li>Island and mainland species should not have been so similar, unless mainland species had changed since arriving on the islands</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Darwin continued his Studies</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>Darwin hypothesized that new species could appear gradually through small changes in ancestral species</li>
        <li>Darwin inferred that if humans could change species by artificial selection - directed breeding to produce offspring with desired traits, then perhaps the same process could work in nature</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Natural Selection</li>
      <ul class="number">
        <li>Darwin described the process of natural selection: some competitors would be better equipped for survival than others, those less equipped would die</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Principles of natural selection</ul>
